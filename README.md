# CoS-E/CommonSenseQA Explanation Generation Fine-tuning (T5 + LoRA)

This project aims to train a T5 based model to perform *common-sense multiple-choice reasoning* **and generate human-like explanations**.  
We use the **CoS-E (Common Sense Explanations)** dataset, which provides:

- A question
- Multiple-choice answer options
- The correct answer
- A human-written rationale (explanation)
